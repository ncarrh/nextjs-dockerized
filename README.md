This is a next js project integrated with nginx server and docker containers.
The hot reload is enabled in development environment.

## Prerequisites

### Docker installation

First download the Docker from the Docker site and follow the instructions

- Open [install instructions](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)

## Getting Started

### development mode

Just run the compose script:

```bash
npm run docker-compose up
```

To watch the logs run the following command

```bash
docker compose logs -f app
```

Open [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
